 # Data-Driven Sustainable Waste Management in the UK 
 In a world with growing urban populations and increasing consumption, effective waste management has become a critical environmental necessity.
This study applies machine learning to reveal patterns in household waste and recycling behavior across English local authorities, using data from 2022–2023

## Objectives 
●	Understand demographic patterns such as population, land area, density, and household distribution across different local authorities. These attributes offer valuable context that can influence how waste is generated and managed in each region.

●	Identify natural groupings among authorities by applying clustering algorithms like KMeans and DBSCAN. By segmenting authorities based on shared characteristics, we aim to uncover hidden patterns in how waste management challenges manifest across urban and rural areas.

●	Evaluate the effectiveness of clustering using robust metrics like Silhouette Score, Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI). These metrics help validate how well the clustering results reflect meaningful separations within the data.

●	Empower stakeholders with an interactive dashboard built using Streamlit, enabling real-time exploration of the results. The dashboard allows users to filter by cluster types, area types, and visualize clusters spatially via PCA, offering a user-friendly interface for informed decision-making.

## Literature Overview 
As the world continues to confront the challenges of rapid urbanization and growing populations, the issue of managing waste sustainably has become increasingly urgent. In the UK alone, over 222 million tonnes of waste were generated in 2018, as reported by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA). A large portion of this waste came from households and municipalities, making the need for effective recycling systems more critical than ever. Despite efforts to improve recycling infrastructure, challenges such as low community involvement, inconsistent regional practices, and inefficient sorting techniques still hinder progress.
Among these techniques, clustering algorithms like KMeans and DBSCAN play a crucial role in uncovering hidden structures within data. These methods group similar regions or communities based on shared characteristics such as population density, land area, and household size. This segmentation has practical applications in:

●	Designing customized recycling education programs for different neighborhoods,

●	Allocating waste collection resources more efficiently, and

●	Identifying areas that may require targeted policy improvements.

Moreover, the development of interactive dashboards has made it easier for decision-makers and the public to explore and interpret data visually. Tools like Streamlit empower researchers to create user-friendly interfaces that make complex insights more accessible, fostering transparency and collaboration.
This project builds upon these insights by combining open UK waste data with clustering techniques and interactive visual tools. The goal is to support the development of smarter, more inclusive, and data-informed waste management strategies across the country.

## Methodology 
To carry out this analysis effectively, a structured, step-by-step approach was followed. The aim was to transform raw waste collection data into meaningful insights through the application of machine learning and interactive visualization tools. Here's how the process unfolded:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The journey began with preparing the dataset titled “Waste Collection and Recycling in England (2022–2023)”, which provides detailed information on various aspects of waste handling across UK local authorities.
The raw data contained some inconsistencies, including missing values and redundant headers. These were addressed by:

●	Removing incomplete or null entries,

●	Renaming columns for clarity, and

●	Pivoting the data to create a structured table with each row representing a unique combination of Authority and Period.
This step ensured a clean foundation Dataset.

Feature Engineering
Once the data was cleaned, relevant features were extracted to better understand the context and characteristics of each authority.
Key attributes selected for analysis included:

●	Population of the authority

●	Geographic area in hectares

●	Population density (derived from population and area)

●	Number of households

These features were chosen for their relevance in influencing waste generation and recycling behavior, especially when comparing urban and rural zones.


## Results & Findings 

The analysis uncovered several meaningful insights into how different regions across the UK compare in terms of population distribution and waste management characteristics:

●	Urban local authorities were found to have significantly higher population densities, often packed into smaller geographic areas. In contrast, rural regions typically covered more land but had fewer people per hectare, reflecting the expected differences in settlement patterns.

●	The use of clustering algorithms proved highly effective in distinguishing between different types of authorities. For instance, compact urban boroughs clustered separately from more spacious rural regions, allowing us to clearly segment areas with similar demographic footprints.

●	Among the two clustering techniques applied, KMeans consistently outperformed DBSCAN in terms of cluster cohesion and separation, as measured by the Silhouette Score. This indicates that KMeans provided more well-defined and meaningful groupings for this dataset.

●	These clusters, once identified, revealed strong connections to demographic features like population, density, and number of households. This opens the door to designing targeted waste strategies — for example, customizing recycling campaigns based on the demographic cluster a borough falls into.

Overall, the results demonstrate how machine learning can uncover hidden patterns in public waste data and support data-informed planning for more efficient and sustainable waste management.

## Conclusion 
This project highlights the power of machine learning and data visualization in tackling real-world environmental challenges—specifically, improving how we manage waste across UK local authorities. By applying clustering techniques to key demographic variables, we were able to uncover meaningful patterns that distinguish densely populated urban areas from their more spacious rural counterparts.
These insights can help guide smarter, data-driven decisions in waste collection, recycling initiatives, and community engagement. The ability to segment authorities into meaningful groups opens the door for targeted policy-making, optimized resource allocation, and localized awareness campaigns—ultimately supporting the UK’s broader goals around sustainability and carbon reduction.
Moreover, the integration of an interactive Streamlit dashboard ensures that these insights are accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders, making it easier to explore, interpret, and act on the findings. This project serves as a practical example of how open data, machine learning, and visual tools can work together to build greener, more efficient communities.
